Early Research:

Definition of home --My definition of home is a place where privacy and openness are combined. Privacy means that each family member should have their own private space, and family members can also use the public space to live together. My definition of family size is about 5-6 people, including parents, wives and children. I think the ideal situation is to live in a three-story building, with parents, you and your children living on different floors. In this case, three generations of people in a family can enjoy their own private space. Since there are some generation gaps between people of different ages, relatively separate and independent living spaces can minimize contradictions within the family. Regarding the understanding of pets in the family, I think that enough space should be given for them to move around. If possible, I think that a semi-open garden should be designed so that it will not affect their normal life, but also allow them to move. Pets are more comfortable. In addition, I think there should be more good memories at home, such as objects with common memories.
