Through the analysis and research of the precedent model, I found that the two buildings have a common feature, which is to expand the space of small buildings by increasing the sense of space (increasing floors). So I made the first design.
In the first design, I divided the whole building into three different heights, namely the bedroom, the living room and the bathroom. Although the height between them is not enough to be a major division of the floor, it can still increase the available space.

And I had a preliminary idea of the arrangement between the two buildings, and arranged them with the following figure. The purpose of this arrangement is to allow two buildings to share the same wall, so that not only the use of wall materials can be reduced, but also the hot water pipeline in the public wall can minimize waste.

In addition, I also got some ideas about the use of hot water pipelines. I think it is a waste to drain the water that still has heat in the cold winter of Utah. So I use pipes (the dotted line as shown in the picture) to turn the hot water used in the bathroom into floor heating to heat the room.

The first analysis and design made me understand the two directions of the subsequent design: 1. Increase the sense of space 2. Use water circulation to save water usage.
