Second Research:

After clarifying the design goals for the next step, I conducted a second research and found new precedent buildings to learn from the architectural ideas.

In this precedent building, I found that due to the small size of the building, the volume of the stairs must be relatively small to not take up too much space. This requires that the height of each step must be relatively high in order to reduce the number of steps.

And I found a building that uses small floors of different heights to increase the building space in the architectural books. I got the idea of using the space on the first floor to build a garage from this building, so my next goal is to add stairs and garages into the design.
