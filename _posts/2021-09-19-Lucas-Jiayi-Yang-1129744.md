Sketch:

Through the design of this sketch, I roughly determined the functional layout of the entire building: that is, the ground floor serves as a functional area that mixes gardens, parking spaces and entrances. The second floor is used as an area for daily life, with tatami mats (bed and sofa combined to reduce the footprint), bathroom and kitchen (including dining area).


Proportion Study


Due to the lack of control over the size of small buildings, I used tape to restore my sketches one-to-one on the open space.

After completing the one-to-one restoration, my understanding of small buildings became clearer and I got more inspiration to complete my next design.
