Reflection：

After a one-to-one reduction, I found some problems and found the answers.

Question 1：

The stairs I designed are too narrow.In my design, the width of the staircase is only about 1 meter wide. Although it is a small building staircase, it is still too inconvenient for people.
After comparing the stairs of the school and mine, I think the width of the stairs should be 1.2 meters.

Question 2:

Most of the gardens on the first floor cannot get enough sunlight due to the influence of the stairs, so I decided to relocate the entire restoration on the first floor to the facade and top of the building. In this way, the vegetation area can be increased, and the vegetation can be greatly increased. Make good use of space.


Question 3：

The position of the entrance on the first floor is redundant. The entrance on the first floor was originally intended to be the dividing line between indoors and outdoors, but in fact it takes up too much space and has little practical effect. So in the next design, I will abandon or reduce this area.


Question 4:

Deviated from the original design direction. In my previous research, I took water recycling as an important design direction, but in this design, I did not put water recycling into my design. Therefore, the water circulation factor should be added in the next design.
