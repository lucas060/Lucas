After the last reflection on the building, I found that the path of the water cycle is a very critical part of the whole building. After checking the information (as shown in the picture above). In the utilization of water recycling, rainwater is an important source, so it is necessary to build a relatively complete rainwater collection and utilization channel. The logic of the whole system is to store rainwater as part of daily life water and garden watering.

Regarding the improvement of the garden, in the last reflection, because the garden cannot receive enough sunlight on the first floor, I need to arrange the garden on the facade, which requires turning a horizontal garden into a vertical garden. Need to transform traditional soilless cultivation into hydroponic plants
In this way, not only the space on the facade can be used, but also the stored rainwater can be used regularly, so as to ensure the cleanness of the rainwater.
