I compared the local precipitation in Wenzhou with the precipitation in Salt Lake City. We can find that the precipitation in Salt Lake City is very low. This shows that the climate in Utah is relatively arid, so storing rainwater is very important. This is also from the side. Explain the necessity for me to establish a water cycle.

From the three pictures above, we can find that a large piece of land on the west side of Salt Lake City is without green vegetation and far away from the Danshui River. Therefore, building a green garden is very necessary for the people who live here.


Through the analysis of the climate and vegetation conditions in Salt Lake City, I finally determined the design direction of the building and made further plans: this building should be about 40-60 square meters, with two floors and a separate parking lot. The building should be covered with green plants, and the vegetation should be irrigated by collecting rainwater on the top of the building.
